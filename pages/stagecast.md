[Stagecast](https://www.stagecast.io/) is an innovative digital solution for audience participation. Over the years they have mastered the Art of Hackathon through their LiveHacks. Initially a regular participant, it wasn't long until providing lighting as a complement to teams for presenting their ideas.
